\contentsline {todo}{TO DO: Your research question will be your guide as your writing proceeds. If you are working independently, you are also free to modify it as you go along. \par How do you know that you have drafted a research question? Most importantly, a research question is something that can be answered. If not, you have probably come up with a theme or field, not a question. \par Some tips: \par Use interrogative words: how, why, which (factors/situations) etc. Some questions are closed and only invoke concrete/limited answers. Others will open up for discussions and different interpretations. Asking \IeC {\textquotedblleft }What \IeC {\textellipsis }?\IeC {\textquotedblright } is a more closed question than asking \IeC {\textquotedblleft }How?\IeC {\textquotedblright } or \IeC {\textquotedblleft }In what way?\IeC {\textquotedblright } Asking \IeC {\textquotedblleft }Why\IeC {\textquotedblright } means you are investigating what causes of a phenomenon. Studying causality is methodologically demanding. Feel free to pose partially open questions that allow discussions of the overall theme, e.g., \IeC {\textquotedblleft }In what way \IeC {\textellipsis }?\IeC {\textquotedblright }; \IeC {\textquotedblleft }How can we understand [a particular phenomenon]?\IeC {\textquotedblright } Try to condense your research question into one general question \IeC {\textendash } and perhaps a few more specific sub-questions (two or three will usually suffice).}{5}{section*.7}
\contentsline {todo}{TO DO: Paradoxically, the more you limit the scope, the more interesting it becomes. This is because a narrower scope lets you clarify the problem and study it at greater depth, whereas very broad research questions only allow a superficial treatment. }{5}{section*.8}
