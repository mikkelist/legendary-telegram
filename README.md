# legendary-telegram

A project that will potentially become a 2D map generator. 

The approach is to construct a cellular automaton which will take an image with set dimensions and randomized content, run a CA simulation step on it a number of times and show the resulting map tile. Constructed map tile can be then copied to the map.

Planned:
 * user interaction via ImGui
 * rendering with GLFW
 * generating map tiles
 * constructing the map from tiles

More features will be added after the documentation is complete.
