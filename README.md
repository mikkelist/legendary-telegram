# legendary-telegram

A project that will potentially become a 2D map generator. 

The approach is to construct a cellular automaton which will take an image with set dimensions and randomized content, run a CA simulation step on it a number of times and show the result.

Planned:
 * interaction via ImGui
 * rendering with GLFW
 * generating map tiles
 * constructing the map from tiles
